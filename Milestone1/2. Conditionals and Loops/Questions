The value of x is 15.
The if conditions check if x is less than or equal to 15, which will return in True and “Inside if” will be printed.

Output Question 2:
Answer : This is an equilateral triangle
Solution Description
As the value of a == b and b == c, it will print "This is an equilateral triangle".

Answer : Indentation error
Solution Description
After the while condition, the indentation of the next statement is wrong. That’s why it will give an indentation error.

Answer : Infinite times 0 will be printed
Solution Description
Here the “i = i + 1” part is out of the while loop. So “i” will not get updated inside while loop and it will run infinitely.

Answer : Numbers from 0 to 9 will be printed
Solution Description
The output will be printed as numbers from 0 to 9 as the indentation is proper.
